The application will be a simple todo app. It will create a user in a database who will be able to create, get and delete todos. If you don’t understand the code or get stuck somewhere, you can check out the code from my Github repository.\nTable of Contents  About the series What you will learn? In this Article Requirements Project Setup Docker Setup  Exploring container from within   Setting up Express server Commiting our changes Conclusion  Did you find this page helpful? Consider sharing it 🙌     About the series This is a series of 3 articles which will help to write production grade code. I wanted to help others who might have faced same problems as me. This article can help a beginner and also to someone who has good knowledge in node.\nWhat you will learn?  TypeScript (if you don’t write it already). Using Docker for Node projects. Writing a GraphQL API instead of REST. Basics of MongoDB. Logging. Working with JWT(Json Web token). Writing tests and working with code coverage. Writing clean code and linting. Writing modular code. Basics of Promises, async and await. Writing production grade code.  In this Article In this article you will be able to do the following things:-\n Setup project Setup docker Write express server and connect to mongodb Write tests for above setup.  Requirements   Node and npm installed for your OS. We will use node environment to work on this project.\n  Docker installed for your OS. Along with local working of project, you will learn little bit of docker and how to work on projects if you don’t have node and npm installed.\n  GraphQL-Playground for testing your API. This is an awesome tool where you will test your APIs and learn how to use this tool.\n  Important :- I will teach how to work with project locally and also how to work with Docker side by side. Those who want to work only with docker, I will refer to them as non npm users. Also we will try to follow TDD(test driven Development) approach.\n  Project Setup Open your development folder and create a new Folder for our project and go to it or copy the following command.\nmkdir graphql-todo\nNow open your code editor inside that folder.\nIf you have npm installed for your OS run\nnpm init -y. It will create a package.json file like this\n{ \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;graphql-todo\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1.0.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;description\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;main\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;index.js\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;scripts\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;test\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;echo \\\u0026quot;Error: no test specified\\\u0026quot; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; exit 1\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;keywords\u0026quot;: [], \u0026quot;author\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;license\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;ISC\u0026quot; }  non npm users just create a package.json file and copy the above contents. You can edit description to anything you like.\nWe will be writing code in Typescript so we will need something that will compile our code fast and minify the process. So for this we will use Gulp. Run the given command below in your terminal inside the project.\nnpm i --quiet gulp gulp-sourcemaps gulp-typescript typescript --save-dev non npm users copy this to your package.json file.\n\u0026quot;devDependencies\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;gulp\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^4.0.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;gulp-sourcemaps\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^2.6.4\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;gulp-typescript\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^5.0.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;typescript\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^3.2.2\u0026quot; }  Now you have gulp and typescript installed. We will now create a gulpfile and write our code to minify the process of building the project. Follow the step below.\nCreate a gulpfile.js inside root directory and copy this code.\nconst gulp = require(\u0026quot;gulp\u0026quot;); const ts = require(\u0026quot;gulp-typescript\u0026quot;); const sourcemaps = require(\u0026quot;gulp-sourcemaps\u0026quot;); const tsProject = ts.createProject(\u0026quot;tsconfig.json\u0026quot;, { typescript: require(\u0026quot;typescript\u0026quot;) }); gulp.task(\u0026quot;build\u0026quot;, () =\u0026gt; { gulp.src(\u0026quot;process.yml\u0026quot;) .pipe(gulp.dest(\u0026quot;dist\u0026quot;)); return tsProject.src() .pipe(sourcemaps.init()) .pipe(tsProject()) .js .pipe(sourcemaps.write()) .pipe(gulp.dest(\u0026quot;dist\u0026quot;)); }); gulp.task(\u0026quot;watchTask\u0026quot;, function () { gulp.watch(\u0026quot;src/**/*.ts\u0026quot;, [\u0026quot;build\u0026quot;]); }); gulp.task(\u0026quot;default\u0026quot;, gulp.series(\u0026quot;build\u0026quot;)); gulp.task(\u0026quot;watch\u0026quot;, gulp.series(\u0026quot;build\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;watchTask\u0026quot;));  Explanation\n  Line 1–3:- We are requiring our modules.\n  Line 4: We are using API of gulp-typescript and creating our TS project using tsconfig.json file which we will create later.\n  Line 8:- We are using Gulp API task and creating a task name build.\n  Line 9–10:- We are using Gulp API src and taking process.yml file as source(we will create it later) and piping it to our destination folder **dist.**Here gulp.src creates a readble stream and with the help of node streams we pipe it to a writable stream created by gulp.dest.\n  Line 12–17:- We are copying our whole code as per tsconfig.json and converting it to Javascript and pasting it to dist folder.\n  Line 20–22:- We are creating another task watchTask for watching any changes in our build task.\n  Line 24–25:- We are finally using Gulp’s default API for runnig build task and watch API for watching changes to build and watch task.\n  Create a tsconfig.json file in root directory and copy this code.\n{ \u0026quot;compilerOptions\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;emitDecoratorMetadata\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;experimentalDecorators\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;outDir\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;./dist\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;moduleResolution\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;node\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;baseUrl\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;./src\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;sourceMap\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;pretty\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;strictNullChecks\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;module\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;commonjs\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;target\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;es6\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;allowJs\u0026quot;: true }, \u0026quot;include\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;src/**/*.ts\u0026quot; ], \u0026quot;exclude\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;node_modules\u0026quot; ] }  Important:- Do notice baseUrl and outDir. baseUrl is where we will write our TS code and outDir is where gulp will compile and copy our code to JavaScript.\nNow create a process.yml file in root directory and copy this code.\napps: - script : 'app.js' name : 'Backend To-do Application' node_args : '--inspect=0.0.0.0:5858'  We will learn why we are creating this file later on. After this create an empty directory src in our root folder. Up until now you might have project config like this. Those who are going to work only with docker, they will not have package-lock.json and node_modules.\nProject setup until now\nTo keep track of our work we will be using git. If not installed you can go through git to install it.\nIn your project initialize your repository as git repository by git init.\nFor working in developement version we will need nodemon and ts-node for reloading our server automatically when any change is made in our file and executing our TS file without building them respectively. We will use TSlint as our code linter. In your terminal inside project directory run this command.\nnpm i --quiet nodemon ts-node tslint tslint-eslint-rules --save-dev\n\u0026quot;nodemon\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^1.18.9\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ts-node\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^7.0.1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;tslint\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^5.12.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;tslint-eslint-rules\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^5.4.0\u0026quot;,  Create a tslint.json file inside root directory and copy the code given below.\n{ \u0026quot;defaultSeverity\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;error\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;extends\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;tslint:recommended\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;tslint-eslint-rules\u0026quot; ], \u0026quot;jsRules\u0026quot;: {}, \u0026quot;rules\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;object-literal-shorthand\u0026quot;: false, \u0026quot;object-literal-sort-keys\u0026quot;: [ false ], \u0026quot;ter-indent\u0026quot;: [ true, 2 ], \u0026quot;no-console\u0026quot;: false, \u0026quot;only-arrow-functions\u0026quot;: [ false ], \u0026quot;member-access\u0026quot;: false, \u0026quot;max-classes-per-file\u0026quot;: [ true, 5 ], \u0026quot;no-shadowed-variable\u0026quot;: false, \u0026quot;interface-name\u0026quot;: [ false ], \u0026quot;max-line-length\u0026quot;: [ true, 200 ], \u0026quot;no-var-requires\u0026quot;: false }, \u0026quot;rulesDirectory\u0026quot;: [] }  Inside scripts in package.json copy the following code.\n\u0026quot;dev\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;nodemon --no-deprecation --watch 'src/**/*.ts' --ignore 'src/**/*.spec.ts' --exec 'ts-node' src/app.ts\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;lint\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;tslint -c tslint.json 'src/**/*.ts' --fix\u0026quot;,  We will use npm run dev for running our code in development mode and npm run lint to lint our code. Now our actual coding will begin. Create a file inside src folder named as app.ts Copy this inside src/app.ts\nfunction testFunction(): string { return \u0026quot;Messi and Ronaldo are legends\u0026quot;; } export default testFunction;  Now we will test this. Create a test folder inside src, and then create a file user-test-spec.ts. For testing we will install required modules. We will be using mocha for testing and chai for assertion. Run this command inside your project.\nnpm i --quiet chai chai-http chai-as-promised mocha mocha-typescript sinon --save-dev\nnon npm users copy this inside devDependencies.\n\u0026quot;chai\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^4.2.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;chai-as-promised\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^7.1.1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;chai-http\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;3.0.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mocha\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^5.2.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mocha-typescript\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^1.1.17\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;sinon\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^7.2.2\u0026quot;,  We will create a script for testing. Copy this code inside scripts\n\u0026quot;test\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;mocha --no-deprecation --timeout 10000 --require ts-node/register **/*.spec.ts\u0026quot;  We can use this command using npm test . So far our package.json will look like this.\n{ \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;graphql-todo\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1.0.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;description\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;This is a GraphQL API for todo application\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;main\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;index.js\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;scripts\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;dev\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;nodemon --no-deprecation --watch 'src/**/*.ts' --ignore 'src/**/*.spec.ts' --exec 'ts-node' src/app.ts\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;lint\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;tslint -c tslint.json 'src/**/*.ts' --fix\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;start\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;gulp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd dist/ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; node --inspect=8990 --no-deprecation app.js\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;test\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;mocha --no-deprecation --timeout 10000 --require ts- node/register **/*.spec.ts\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;keywords\u0026quot;: [], \u0026quot;author\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;license\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;ISC\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;devDependencies\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;chai\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^4.2.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;chai-as-promised\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^7.1.1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;chai-http\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;3.0.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;gulp\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^4.0.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;gulp-sourcemaps\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^2.6.4\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;gulp-typescript\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^5.0.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mocha\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^5.2.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mocha-typescript\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^1.1.17\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;nodemon\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^1.18.9\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;sinon\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^7.2.2\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ts-node\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^7.0.1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;tslint\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^5.12.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;tslint-eslint-rules\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^5.4.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;typescript\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^3.2.2\u0026quot; } }  Inside your src/test/user-test.spec.ts copy this code\nimport chai = require(\u0026quot;chai\u0026quot;); import chaiAsPromised = require(\u0026quot;chai-as-promised\u0026quot;); import { suite, test } from \u0026quot;mocha-typescript\u0026quot;; import testFunction from \u0026quot;../app\u0026quot;; chai.use(chaiAsPromised); @suite(\u0026quot;User Test class\u0026quot;) class UserTests { @test(\u0026quot;testFunction Test - It works fine\u0026quot;) public testFunction(done) { chai.expect(testFunction()).to.deep.equal(\u0026quot;Messi and Ronaldo are legends\u0026quot;); done(); } }  Explanation:-\n  Line 1–4:- We are importing test modules and our file app.ts\n  Line 7–8:- We are defining suite to run and defining our class UserTests.\n  Line 10–16:- @test will declare the test message we are running, we also define a public test to run. We use chai.expect to test assetion of test.\n  Run your test by running npm test . If everything works fine, it will look like this.\nTo calculate test coverage of our code we will use nyc. We need to first check that our project is building or not. Copy this to scripts and then run npm run build\n\u0026quot;build\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;gulp\u0026quot;  You will get output as show below and a dist folder will be created.\nAdd nyc module by running npm i --quiet nyc --save-dev , non npm users copy this into package.json\n\u0026quot;nyc\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^13.1.0\u0026quot;  Add the command given below to scripts.\n\u0026quot;coverage\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;nyc --reporter=text mocha --no-deprecation --timeout 10000 dist/test/*.spec.js -x dist/test/*.spec.js\u0026quot;,  We need to build to latest code first, then after that we will run code coverage by running npm run build \u0026amp;\u0026amp; npm run coverage. This will create a .nyc_output folder, from which our code coverage will be seen. You will see following output.\n Above image shows that we have achieved 💯 code coverage which depicts that we have not written any unusable code.\n Docker Setup Now we will setup docker so that non npm users can also run tests and build project without installing node or npm. I assume that the readers have a basic understanding of docker. If you have never used docker before you might wanna check out this guide for getting started with Docker.\nCreate a Dockerfile inside root directory and copy this\nFROM node:8 # Install gulp and pm2 globaly RUN npm install --quiet -g gulp pm2 # Create app directory RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/ WORKDIR /usr/src/ # Install app dependencies COPY package.json /usr/src/ RUN npm install --quiet # Bundle app source COPY . /usr/src # Build the project RUN npm run build WORKDIR /usr/src/dist EXPOSE 4895 EXPOSE 5858 CMD [\u0026quot;pm2-docker\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;process.yml\u0026quot;]  Explanation:-\n  Line 1:- We are use Node image having version 8.\n  Line 4:- We globally install gulp and pm2. PM2 is a Production Runtime and Process Manager for Node.js applications with a built-in Load Balancer.\n  Line 7:- We create a new directory /usr/src/ inside our docker image.\n  Line 9:- We set /usr/src/ as our working directory inside the docker image.\n  Line 12:- We copy package.json from root directory to our working directory.\n  Line 14:- We install node modules inside docker image.\n  Line 17:- We copy rest of our code from root directory to our working directory.\n  Line 20:- We build our project using gulp. We already installed gulp inside our docker image in line 4.\n  Line 22:- We set our working directory as /usr/src/dist/ as our JS code is compiled there.\n  Line 26:- We execute pm2 and using our process.yml file that we created earlier to start the application inside docker image.\n  We need to build docker image using this Dockerfile. Add a scripts folder inside root directory and create a dockerCompose.sh file inside it. Copy the following code inside scripts/dockerCompose.sh:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash cd .. docker build -t knrt10/todoapi -f Dockerfile . docker-compose up -d  Add this inside scripts in your package.json.\n\u0026quot;dockerStart\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;cd scripts \u0026amp;\u0026amp; chmod 777 dockerCompose.sh \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./dockerCompose.sh \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd ..\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;dockerStop\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;docker-compose down\u0026quot;  Now that you know how to create an image with a Dockerfile, let’s create an application as a service and connect it to a database. Then we can run some setup commands and be on our way to creating rest of application.\nThe Docker Compose file will define and run the containers based on a configuration file. We are using compose file version 2 syntax, and you can read about it on Docker’s site.\nAn important concept to understand is that Docker Compose spans buildtime and runtime. Up until now, we have been building images using docker build ., which is buildtime. This is when our containers are actually built. We can think of runtime as what happens once our containers are built and being used.\nCompose triggers buildtime— instructing our images and containers to build — but it also populates data used at runtime, such as env vars and volumes. This is important to be clear on. For instance, when we add things like volumes and command, they will override the same things that may have been set up via the Dockerfile at buildtime.\nOpen your docker-compose.yml file in your editor in root directory and copy/paste the following lines:\nversion: '3' services: web: build: . command: npm run dev volumes: - .:/usr/src/ - /usr/src/node_modules ports: - \u0026quot;3000:3000\u0026quot; depends_on: - mongodb mongodb: image: mongo ports: - \u0026quot;27017:27017\u0026quot; volumes: - ./data:/data/db  Explanation:-\nThe first directive in the web service is to build the image based on our Dockerfile. This will recreate the image we used before, but it will now be named according to the project we are in, graphql-todo. After that, we are giving the service some specific instructions on how it should operate:\n  Line 5:- Once the image is built, and the container is running, the npm start command will start the application.\n  Line 6:- volumes: – This section will mount paths between the host and the container.\n  Line 7:- .:/usr/src/ – This will mount the root directory to our working directory in the container.\n  Line 8:- /usr/src/node_modules – This will mount the node_modules directory to the host machine using the buildtime directory.\n  Line 9:- ports: – This will publish the container’s port, in this case 3000, to the host as port 3000\n  Line 11:- This depicts on what database image it depends on. We are using mongodb so we will specify mongodb\n  Line 14:- It will build mongodb image.\n  Line 15:- Same as nodejs we specify version of mongodb image here.\n  Line 17:- ports: – This will publish the container’s port, in this case 27017, to the host as port 27017\n  Now before executing this script, check your docker is up and running. This command will execute our scripts/dockerCompose.sh file. This file builds our docker image. Now run npm run dockerStart\nIf everything goes right you will see this output. This means your docker image is created.\nSuccessfully built 2597b7c50ed4 Successfully tagged graphql-todo_web:latest Creating graphql-todo_mongodb_1 ... done Creating graphql-todo_web_1 ... done  You can get information about your running containers using the command given below.\ndocker ps -a\nYou will see this kind of output\nCopy the NAMES for image graphql-todo_web and run this\ndocker exec -it graphql-todo_web_1 -- /bin/bash\nThis will run bash inside the existing graphql-todo_web_1 container. The bash process will have the same Linux namespaces as the main container process. This allows you to explore the container from within and see how Node.js and your app see the system when running inside the container. The -it option is shorthand for two options:\n  -i, which makes sure STDIN is kept open. You need this for entering commands into the shell.\n  -t, which allocates a pseudo terminal (TTY).\n  Exploring container from within Now you can run same commands as other users who have node installed.

I had been contributing to my organization like crazy, creating PRs after PRs, raising issues and helping out fellow contributors and other aspiring GSoCers on the community\u0026rsquo;s slack team.\nThe day of the results came and out of the two slots given to my organization my project wasn\u0026rsquo;t in the list of selected projects. It was hard at first, I thought I had done everything right but still my name wasn\u0026rsquo;t up there.\nThe next morning I decided not to waste my time anymore and started to look at the bright side of things, contributing to open source project helped me learn invaluable skills like test driven development, CI/CD, git (rebasing, merge conflicts), etc. I may not be getting any stipend for writing code throughout the summer but I earned some invaluable skills which I can use in my future projects.\nSo it was exam time and I was hacking on one of my project’s as usual (a CLI tool to upload images to a cloud service) when one of my cool friends (Palash Nigam) entered my room and said with a tone of surprise “You don’t know how to touch type? That’s pathetic” 😀. So he introduced me to this site called typeracer (so I listened to him and started practicing on that site and I was hooked). One of my seniors from college (Shibasis Patel) gave me this idea of creating a CLI tool to play typeracer (as I had earlier asked him for some project ideas) which we could use to introduce the freshmen to both the shell and touch typing. This gave me a new purpose, so I started coding. After about a week of writing code I am proud to present to you typeracer-CLI\nWhat is typeracer-cli? So it is basically a terminal client for playing typeracer on your shell. As soon as you start the game you will be presented with a paragraph which you have to type out and at the end your time and speed (in wpm) are recorded and presented as an output.\n What’s new about this? CLI versions of this game already exist. Agreed, other versions of this already exists but they don’t offer all the features that this client does, like:\n  Practice mode (offline mode) User stats (words per minute, time taken) Online mode (have a type-race by spawning up a server and sharing it with your friends) Ask for a rematch after the race ends (online mode) View the top 10 High scores in online mode  The motivation behind it Well, they say failure is a great motivator. I learned this the hard way. Failing in getting selected for GSoC motivated me even more to be a better developer. The other big reason was the desire to do something for my college. I had realized the benefits of working in a developer community during the time I was preparing for GSoC. Although I was a part of my college’s Programming Society I hadn’t contributed as actively as I should have. This project turned out to be one of the ways of contributing to my community by spreading awareness about touch typing and CLI tools among young aspiring developers who are just starting out.\nImplementation Initially the task was to get keystrokes from the user’s terminal which at that time I thought was impossible. But I found about readline and keyspress events in nodejs which helped me to move further in coding.\nThe tasks were broken up into the following:\n Conver this tool to an npm package Offline practice mode Generate random paragraph for every race Add more sensible paragraphs Display the user’s time and speed as they type Setup server for online mode Improve the API Design Write tests  Getting into every point in detail Converting it to an npm package This was important task so that one can easily download the package and install it globally from npm. For that we need to use a very important line on the start of the file that is going to execute.\n #!/usr/bin/env node is an instance of a shebang line: the very first line in an executable plain-text file on Unix-like platforms that tells the system what interpreter to pass that file to for execution, via the command line following the magic #! prefix (called shebang)\n Although Windows does not support shebang lines, so they’re effectively ignored there; on Windows it is solely a given file’s filename extension that determines what executable will interpret it. However, you still need them in the context of npm.\nImplementing the offline (practice) mode Initially some commands were written for the execution of practice mode. With the help of a package commander I was able to achieve this task.\nprogram .command('practice') .alias('p') .description('Starts typeracer in practice mode') .action(() =\u0026gt; { game() })  game() function This is main logic that allows the application to get keystrokes from the client, but we also have to listen to keypress event for completion of this task. stdin.on('keypress', keypress)\nconst stdin = process.stdin const stdout = process.stdout stdin.setRawMode(true) stdin.resume() require('readline').emitKeypressEvents(stdin)  Now in game() I was enabling keypress event after 5 seconds of game, and showing paragraphs to user so that they get time to relax their fingers, twist turn their neck, crack their knuckles and say “bring it on”.\nI was displaying three things to client when they were typing\n Real time analysis of their typing with green, red representing correct and wrong characters respectively.  /** * @function color * @param {String} quote * @param {String} stringTyped */ function color (quote, stringTyped) { let colouredString = '' let wrongInput = false const quoteLetters = quote.split('') const typedLetters = stringTyped.split('') for (let i = 0; i \u0026lt; typedLetters.length; i++) { // if a single mistake, // the rest of the coloured string will appear red if (wrongInput) { colouredString += chalk.bgRed(quoteLetters[i]) continue } if (typedLetters[i] === quoteLetters[i]) { wrongInput = false colouredString += chalk.green(quoteLetters[i]) if (quote === stringTyped) { gameEnd = true } } else { wrongInput = true colouredString += chalk.bgRed(quoteLetters[i]) } } return colouredString }   Real time analysis of their speed in words per minute.  The following snippet explains how to get the speed of a user according to correct words typed by them.\n/** * @function updateWpm */ function updateWpm () { if (stringTyped.length \u0026gt; 0) { wordsPermin = stringTyped.split(' ').length / (time / 60) } }   Calculating the time taken  /** * @function Time */ function Time () { time = (Date.now() - timeStarted) / 1000 }  In the end there is an option to retry where you can restart the match with generation of new paragraph every time.\nOnline Mode This was very important feature to implement as this sets this client apart from other CLI versions. This was implemented using socket.io accordingly:\n Creating a server Connecting clients to the server Create private room for competition Send scores to all clients at end of game Rematch feature Random paragraphs for every race Top 10 high scores  Getting into every point in detail Creating a server I am quite fluent with Javascript and NodeJs, so I used NodeJs for creating server of the application and hosted in on Glitch.\nSocket.io was used to provide web sockets for clients to connect and emit events for server to listen. MongoDB was used as database for storing top 10 high scores of clients.\nConnecting clients to sever Initially the client part was quite tricky as I had not understood socket.io upto basic level. At first I was working on local server or you can localhost. I was using socket.io client for client side but still took me a whole day to understand the basic and connect a client to the server.\nCreating a private room for competition Now in socket.io you can create different namespace or you can say rooms to join. So I had to get some input from user to create a private channel where they can race otherwise it would create countless problems. I used the crypto node module to provide cryptographic functionality that includes a set of wrappers for OpenSSL’s hash, HMAC, cipher, decipher, sign, and verify functions and generated random strings with it every time.\nconst roomNumber = crypto .randomBytes(12) .toString('base64') .replace(/[+/=]+/g, '')  Another problem was how the server would know the number of players in a room so that it can emit an event for race to start. For that I asked number of players from client they wanted to race with (using the npm package inquirer.)\nSo when the user joined the room I emitted all the information of client to sever so that it can work according to that.\n// Emitting client info on joining the room _socket.on('room', function (val) { _socket.emit('join', {roomName: val.value, username: data.username, number: data.number, randomNumber: data.randomNumber}) })  Now when the server knew that all the clients have joined the race it emitted an event to clients and started the race. It was important to send random paragraphs on every connection and also same paragraph to all clients in a same room.\n/** * @function randomNumRetry */ function randomNumRetry () { randomNumber = Math.floor((Math.random() * paras.length)) quote = paras[randomNumber].para if (quote.length \u0026lt; 100) { quote = paras[randomNumber].para + ' ' + paras[randomNumber - 1].para } return quote }  When everything was in order and every client completed the race, the server emitted an event sending all the scores to every client and asking if they wanted a rematch. Similarly for a rematch random paragraph was generated.\nTop 10 high scores For this feature to work I initially created a shell database with ten anonymous users with their scores initialized to 0. Now whenever someone plays an online game and score greater than 10th highest score in database, it replaces the 10th highest scorer with the user in the database (this was done to avoid excessive use of database).\n// Getting documents from databse Score.findOne({_id: process.env.ID}, (err, players) =\u0026gt; { if (err) throw new Error(err) let playersArray = players.players.sort(function (a, b) { return b.score - a.score }) let lowestScore = [] lowestScore.push(playersArray[playersArray.length - 1].score) // checking if last score is less then current score function remove () { // First removing last player Score.update({_id: process.env.ID}, {$pop: {players: 1}}, (err) =\u0026gt; { if (err) throw new Error(err) console.log('Removed last player') }) } function add () { // Then updating current player Score.update({_id: process.env.ID}, {$push: {players: {score, username}}}, (err) =\u0026gt; { if (err) throw new Error(err) console.log('Added new High score') }) } async function update () { // Then again sorting it correctly await Score.update({_id: process.env.ID}, {$push: {players: {$each: [], $sort: -1}}}, (err) =\u0026gt; { if (err) throw new Error(err) console.log('Sorted in descending order after adding') }) } if (score \u0026gt; lowestScore[0]) { (async () =\u0026gt; { Promise.all([update()]).then(async () =\u0026gt; { await remove() await add() await update() }) })() } })  Support Us This project was a great learning experience for me and we (my friends and I) are looking to build more such awesome projects in the future. We are a bunch of undergrads passionate about software development looking to make cool stuff. A little motivation and support helps us a lot. If you like this nifty hack you can support us by doing any (or all 😉 ) of the following:\n ⭐️ Star us on Github and make it trend so that other people can know about our project.
